# PR Name Check Action

### What does it do

This action validates pull request titles. For example, it validates with the following formats:

```
[SW-123] text
[SGP-123] text
[no-ticket] text
```

The prefixes `SW` and `SGP` are configurable. Also the `no-ticket` string. If the pull request title doesn't satisfy the format,
this action will notify you.

### How it notifies you

This action can fail and appear as a red cross in the pull request checks, or it can request changes with a comment.

### How to use it

Example workflow file you should create in `.github/workflows/pr-name-check.yml` in your project. Adjust it to your needs.

```yaml

  pull_request:
